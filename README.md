# GANs_on_limited_data
Exploring to solve the problem of limited data by using GANs to create synthetic images from a handful of images. This project was done in 2021.

Using pre-trained GPGAN and StyleGAN-ADA (originally trained on medical images for breast cancer) to see what kind of synthetic images it would generate.
